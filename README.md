# BUDDYWORKS Locomotion "C0p1um Edition"
The pinnacle of inventions, BUDDYWORKS proudly presents: **BUDDYWORKS LOCOMOTION!**  
It's real, you just have to look for it.

## Features
In this groundbreaking invention, you will gain an assortment of buttons... that do things!  
You might say *"HERESY!"...* but no: You have been fooled all along.  
After all this time, all those friends we made along the way, it all accumulates to this release. Brace yourself, you are facing a storm you didn't see coming.

Innovation in all the fields:

### HYPERTHREADING!!!111eleven
Poses are fine and dandy, but why restrict to a single pose at a time?  
Why not like... all of them?
Mix and match poses to get the exact style you want, the possibilities are endless!  
Laying down sitting on a barchair? Sure!  
Pronely standing up? Absolutely!  

**Think it, make it!**

### Don't fly, change position of existence!
Flying is neat and all, but what if you could just think of a place and immediately be there?  
From the VRChat Default Home straight to peeping at people in Black Cat's bathroom stalls and back, everything is possible.

**Truly exist, wherever you want.**

### Ryzen X3D-who?
No one would have thought that a locomotion system would be capable of skyrocketing your performance to infinity, but here we are.  
If you think you dropped a frame, think again!

**Pushing forward 24/7**

### Be the reflective surface.
All people do is looking for the next mirror?  
Be the mirror! No one will be able to take their eyes off you.  
Take advantage of the latest and greatest RTX-Technology for a perfect reflection of your surroundings, while keeping your fragile ego hidden safe and sound.

**Narcissism taken to the next level!**

### And so much more!
You think this kind of paragraph is just a marketing filler to imply there is more even when there is not?
Rude, you will find out soon enough.

**Beyond the limits!**

## What the press says

- "I went to FBT Heaven with this and never dropped a frame!"
- "Finally, I can stare at the reflection of my reflection: An infinite loop!"
- "I was thinking: How could this get any better? Then I stood up while still lying down! Mind bending!"
- "There was someone randomly peeking through the window in my private instance, that funky locomotion system certainly works but that is kinda off."
- "I always wondered if you could wait faster... With this locomotion system, I can!"

## Addendum

Thank you to everyone who supported me and follows my work, I have a lot of fun challenging myself to learn new and interesting things. I have a couple of overambitious ideas I would like to work on.

Shoutouts go out to all those who make creation a joy, providing useful tools and fixing the SDK's and Unitys various shortcomings. Your stuff is invaluable and I couldn't work without them. Special shoutout to Dreadrith, his tools are a necessity in my toolchain and so should they be in yours.

Of course also a big heartfelt thank you to all those I have the honor to call my friends, all those I know and ever love.

And a big shoutout to you reading this mess, I hope all this got a kek out of you. <3
